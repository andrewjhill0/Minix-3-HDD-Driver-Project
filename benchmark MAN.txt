.SH DESCRIPTION
.de SP
.if t .sp 0.4
.if n .sp
..
.B main
will run through four sets of procedure.  Each procedure will determine the time of day first.  It will then begin a for loop set to run X amount of times (in the default case, 10 times).  Within this for loop 
the program will open a device driver (mydriver, zero, null) or a file (testFile.txt) and then proceed to
read 25 MB worth of data into the character buffer defined within the program of (1024 * 25600) bytes size.


.SP
The program will then close each file descriptor, get the time of day again, and then print the difference
in time from start to finish in milliseconds to the screen. 


.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE
This program does not return any values.  It only prints to the screen.


.SH ERRORS
.B main
will fail and crash/return EINVAL if one or more of the
following are true:
.TP 15
One of the drivers are improperly programmed to accept the size of data to be read that is passed to them.
.SP
The file descriptor to be opened does not exist.  Will return EINVAL.


.SH  Testing procedure

The program and driver were tested using a couple different sizes of blocks, read amounts, and char buffer
sizes.  It was determined that the buffer within benchmark must be at least the size (preferably equal to) the number of bytes being read.  The buffer within the mydriver driver should be equal to the number of bytes being copied to the benchmark program on each of its loops.  Thus, the buffer will be copied 
iov->iov_size/block_size times.
